Hi,

I built this project with angular 13.2(latest).

How to run->

take a clone of th repo.
make sure you are using node version > 12.1. I used 12.2.
to switch node versions use nvm.
install angular CLI using npm install -g @angular/cli
cd learnANgular.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


I took almost 6-7 hours to build this.
Took me like an hour reading about promises, props and other important things in angular 13.2

The app includes a searchInput,searchList and searchContainer component.
I have included the pagination in my search-container as I was previosly handling my functions from this container.
